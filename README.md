Not a whole lot going on here yet, as I'm just starting my GitHub journey.  But I am trying to branch out into open source, throw my own contributions into the ring, and maybe one day be able to say I know what I'm doing, hopefully.  I'll attempt to make this prettier as I learn more about the markdown conventions of github.
